        Documentation - <i>(Dev Log)</i>

      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        When beginning to research different topics, my initial concept was related to video games, but still very broad. After numerous workshopping periods, my research question was narrowed down to read as;
      </p><br>
        <blockquote class="col-sm-offset-3">
        <b><i>
          How is the study of psychology used in successful game design?
        </i></b>
        </blockquote><br>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        This particularly made the rest of the project simple in some ways, but more complicated in others. For starters, this particular question made it really simple to begin looking for research, but when it came to finding good resources, it became increasingly more difficult to find anything of value. Specific search terms that came in handy at the time of researching were 
      <i>
        Psychology, Game Design, Behaviour, Cognition, Player Choice, Player Agency.
      </i>
        All of the terms listed here helped me find useful information on, Psychology in Game Design, my topic of choice.
      </p>

        Context
      </h1>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        When trying to decide on a topic for the project, I wasn't sure which direction to go. I love music, manga, anime, cartoons, comics and movies just as much as I love video games, however, I think I felt inclined to learn more about game design as it was the one field of the bunch that I didn't know nearly as much about.<br><br>This class allowed me the opportunity to explore something of my own interests, and although I knew very little about the technical side of game design, video games are a larger interest of mine compared to all the previously mentioned media. Additionally, I can't deny my own curiosity in wanting to learn how expansive, and difficult, game design and game development truly is.

        Research Process
      </h1>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        When researching the topic of psychology in game design, there were only so many places to start, so with that in mind, I started at the most logical point by learning about some different sub-fields of psychology;</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="col-sm-offset-3">
          <b><i>Behavioural Psychology, Social Psychology and Cognitive Psychology</i></b>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        At this point, I began to start doing little bits of additional research into the specific studies regarding the three. Specific elements that are present in studying the three forms of psychology respectively. At the same time as researching each individual field of psychology, I began playing a lot of video games, and studying each one to determine the ways in which the designers use game design elements to force the player without explicitly telling them what to do or how to do it. 
      </p>
      <blockquote class="col-sm-offset-3">

        Example;

      <p class="p1 col-sm-7 ">
        Role-Playing Games or RPGs for short are titles that aim to put the player in control. Unlike other games, however, the player is meant to be in control of everything from strength, to speed, to the colour of their characters funky anime haircut. The RPG genre is a favourite in both the West and in East Asia, in countries like Japan and Korea. The markets where they succeed, however important, is not as important as <i>why</i> they're so popular. When developers are making an RPG title, they have to consider ways in which the player will stay invested.
      <br><br>
        RPG titles use gameplay mechanics, like leveling systems and frequent reward patters to control the players behaviour. When game designers are designing RPG elements, designers should (if they don't already) aim to reward players on a very frequent basis to further the players engagement.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        Specifics and examples aside, I didn't find the research in any books or journals, rather a majority of the sources were found on psychology websites, blogs, and in some cases, YouTube videos. I ran into a major issue when doing research on the field of game design and it's link with Psychology. That issue being a major lack of information compared to other media. Thing is, game design is still a relatively new field when compared to media like movies and music, and there's so many things that even designers are unable to teach as a lot of knowledge comes from playing games, and storing that information subconcsiously. In a lot of cases, designers don't know why they need to make something the way they do, yet they go through the trouble to make said thing anyway. Myself included, and that is present with this particular project.

        Deliverables (& Breakdown)
      </h1>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        <b>Preface: You can find the game at the top of this page!</b>
        <br><br>
        The final deliverable is a playable game-more like a mechanical demo, if we're gonna tell the truth, but the playable section is based on a lot of small elements taken from my knowledge and experience with different kinds of games. 
        <br><br>
        The game is titled <i>Uplink</i> (title subject to change), and the name comes from a story that I plan to turn this into. Due to time constraints, however, this is only meant to provide a short look into the what the final product might play like. 
        <br><br>
        Some of my favourite games of this generation are games called Metroid-vanias. Think Super Mario but things will actively try to kill you as opposed to just walk up to you. For the gameplay, I took some inspiration from those types of games in the collection mechanic. The way the keys exist around the level, and the UI that keeps track of them (seen below) are seen in every Metroid-vania style game. Below are a couple of examples;
      </p>
      <br>
      <img class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-2" src="images/game1.png">
      <figcaption class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-2">Key collection and UI elements.<br>This mechanic and the UI are inspired by games like Metroid and Hollow Knight.</figcaption>
      <br>
      <img class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-2" src="images/metroid1.webp">
      <figcaption class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-2">Metroid: Small UI and health orbs are dropped upon killing an enemy (collection).</figcaption> 
      <br>
      <img class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-2" src="images/hollowknight1.jpg">
      <figcaption class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-2">Hollow Knight: Small UI and lots of camera space around the player.</figcaption> 
      <br>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        In a similar way to Super Mario style platformers, however, the "enemies", don't hunt you down, but rather exist only to hinder your progress. You cannot die, but that doesn't mean that they don't have an effect on the gameplay experience, and although potentially a very <i>un-fun</i> gameplay experience, it doesn't mean the gameplay experience or the value of the players experience are lessened in any way.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-2" src="images/game2.png">
        <br>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        See that blue thing? The only things you will run into that look different from you-the blue hexagons-are the "enemies". To reiterate, they don't harm you, but they have pose a chance of hindering your progress, even if only slightly. There is no damage on either side of the equation, meaning just as they can't hurt you, you can't kill them.         
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h1 class="head1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        What comes next?
      </h1>
      <p class="p1 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        Given the fact that this project exists, I'm proud that I was able to put something together with very little knowledge about the work it would take, and the process behind making a game. By no means does that mean this was easy. It was a very long and tedious process, and at times, incredibly frustrating. Coding a website is one thing, but coding a game, even in a node-based system made to make game development easier is a completely different beast in it's entirety. It's taxing, but seeing everything come together was an incredibly rewarding experience. 
        <br><br>
        The entirety of this project, from the research to the development, and even to the deliverable (the playable game above) was a learning experience. Throughout this process, I went from knowing nothing about how to use the Unity engine, to knowing and understanding the software at an intermediate level. I learned about the use of UI and the process of UI design from an angle that we never learned about in the program, because it takes on a new form in a context completely untouched by such a large number of industry people, UI/UX designers included. The research was very rewarding in and of itself as well. I was able to research a topic that I had previously known very little about, and was able to use that research to inform the creation of this project, a project that I've put too much work in to scrap. 
        <br><br>
        In terms of process, there isn't much that can be shown besides the final product. Both Game Design and Graphic Design are iterative in nature, however, they're iterative in different ways. When designing a logo, you have the workspace that you can show off. When designing a game, all game designers, including specifically Unity users all recommend you don't make copies of you projects and scenes as these things run the risk of overwriting all the work you've put in thus far. Additionally, they recommend making backups, but backups don't keep track of process or progress. Creating a backup should be a cloud save of the most recent build, so like the final file, it updates immediately and only keeps the most recent changes with no way to revert backwards to an earlier version. Might I try, there is no real way to keep track of the work outside of a Dev Log format like this, and to be honest, that caused me some trouble earlier in the semester. 
        <br><br>
        The next steps of the project are simple. Continue to work on it to create a game I'm proud to release publicly into the world, and if possible, learn and master UI design while I'm at it. Aside from the obvious motion design path, I would like to take a stab at working in the games industry, even if only for a short period. I learned a ridiculous amount about making games during this project, which I suppose is the best end result I could have asked for.
